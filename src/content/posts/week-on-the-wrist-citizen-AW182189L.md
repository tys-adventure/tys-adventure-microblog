Somewhere along my path of interests and hobbies, two rather seemingly different worlds collide... sustainability and timepieces. I've been a closeted "obsessed watch nerd" for many many years. It started as something I was used to seeing around my family. My father and grandfather always had a watch on their wrist. Not the storied Rolex that will get handed down to the next as you might always hear, but to me they were nice watches none the less. As I grew older, my parents must have took note of my interest in timepieces because I received a now "retro" looking Armitron watch for either a birthday or Christmas one year in my younger teens. A stainless steel, integrated bracelet square watch that I still own and admire from time to time(albeit I don't wear it anymore). The dark blue dial with what I assume to be CZ like diamonds as indices at 3, 6, 9, and 12 still tickles something within me these days, and it's nice to look at and reminisce of a much simpler and different time of life.

Since theA Week on the Wrist - Citizen Eco Drive AW1821-89Ln, I've bought, wore, lost, and sold many watches... the 'Watch Bug' is more alive in me these days than ever as I've not only developed a love for watch making, but also a deep appreciation for these things that most people don't think twice about. I could probably go on for hours about how inspired I feel when I get to see watches and why I love them, but I won't. Let's dive into my most recent acquisition, the **Citizen AW1821-89L**.

### Who is Citizen?
I can't really explain this watch without giving you a background of who Citizen is.
